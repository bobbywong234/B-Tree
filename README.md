# B-Tree
Data.cs is Generic Type that you can used for inserting data to the B-Tree. Hence, the data type of this B-Tree totally depends on your code.</br></br>

The FrontEndStructing.js will show how front-end code parses tree data. </br></br>

Addtionally, the ajax Url would be the api you can do on the B-tree, so you can write some code on the WebApi or SpringFramework to get to know B-Tree more deeply.</br></br>
